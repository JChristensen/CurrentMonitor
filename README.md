## Overview
The Current Monitor is an Arduino Uno-compatible board designed to function as a sensor node in an XBee network. While the board was primarily designed to interface to current transformers, it is also general enough to have wider applicability. Features include:
- ATmega328P microcontroller
- interface circuitry for two current transformers
- two analog pins (for current transformers) and four digital pins brought out to screw-type terminal blocks
- three on-board LEDs
- interface circuitry and 3.3V supply for the XBee module
- powered from most any 7-12VDC wall wart with a 2.5mm plug

[Hardware design](https://github.com/JChristensen/CurrentMonitor) and [an Arduino Current Transformer library](https://github.com/JChristensen/CurrentTransformer) are available on GitHub.  
PC boards can be ordered from [OSH Park](https://www.oshpark.com/shared_projects/QCjudQBh).  
A bill of materials is available at [Mouser Electronics](https://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?State=EDIT&ProjectGUID=d999f360-1612-415f-8324-2acceb9dd570) and also in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/JChristensen/CurrentMonitor).
